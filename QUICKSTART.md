## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the steps of setting up the Infineon [CY8CKIT-062S2-AI](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s2-ai/)
to run this application on IoTConnect.

## 2. Prerequisites
This guide has been tested with the following environment, but should work with other operating systems.
* PC with Windows 10/11
* USB-A to USB-C data cable
* WiFi Network with Internet access
* A serial terminal application such as [Tera Term](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tera-term/) (Recommended) or a browser-based version such as [Google Chrome Labs Serial Terminal](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/serial-terminal/)
* A registered [myInfineon Account](https://www.infineon.com/sec/login)
* PSoCâ„¢ 6 Artificial Intelligence Evaluation Kit (CY8CKIT-062S2-AI)

## 3. Hardware Setup
* Connect the  board to a USB port your PC. A new USB device should be detected.

## 4. Flash the Firmware

* Configure settings as shown below:
  * Port: (Select the COM port with the device)
  * Speed: `115200`
  * Data: `8 bits`
  * Parity: `none`
  * Stop Bits: `1`
  * Flow Control: `none`
  * In the Transmit Delay section of the serial port setting, enter 10 for both per-character and per-line delay. 
* After setup, connect and reset the board.

## 7. Cloud Account Setup
An IoTConnect account is required.  If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is available.

Select one of the two implementations of IoTConnect:
* [AWS Version](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws)  (Recommended)
* [Azure Version](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=azure)  

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

See the IoTConnect [Subscription Information](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/subscription.md) for more details on the trial.

## 8. Acquire IoTConnect Account Information
Login to IoTConnect using the corresponding link below to the version for which you registered:  
* [IoTConnect on AWS](https://console.iotconnect.io) (Recommended)
* [IoTConnect on Azure](https://portal.iotconnect.io)

The Company ID (**CPID**) and Environment (**ENV**) variables identifying your IoTConnect account must be configured for the device.
* Take note of these values for later reference located in the "Settings" -> "Key Vault" section of the platform. See image below.

<img src="https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/bbdc9f363831ba607f40805244cbdfd08c887e78/assets/cpid_and_env.png" width=600>


## 9. Configure the Board

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is no local echo in the serial terminal when typing or pasting values (unless you enabled this option in the TeraTerm settings).
> If a mistake is made, the board must be reset and this section repeated.

* Verify the following output is visible in the terminal:  `Please enter your device configuration`
* If not, reset the board.

> [!NOTE] 
> To change an existing configuration reset the board and press `y` and then `ENTER` when prompted.

* Enter the **Platform** for which you subscribed: `aws` (for AWS) or `az` (for Azure)
* Enter the **CPID** acquired from the key vault in Step 8
* Enter the **ENV** (Environment) acquired from the key vault in Step 8
* Enter your **WiFi SSID**
* Enter your **WiFi Password**

The device will configure itself and reboot.

The application will display the auto-generated certificate from flash upon boot.

> [!CAUTION]  
> This certificate will be re-generated every time you re-flash the board because the flash section
> where the certificate and private key are stored will be erased.
> In this case, you will need to delete your device from IoTConnect and re-create the device with the new certificate.
> If you wish to avoid this, you should use the Developer Guide and 
> have your device credentials compiled into the application.

* **Copy** the *Device Certificate* from the terminal including the "BEGIN" and "END" lines.
* Open a text editor, such as notepad, paste in the certificate, and save the file as `cert.txt`

  ```
* **Copy** the Device Unique ID *(DUID)* from the terminal and save for later use.

* Ensure the device is able to connect to the WiFi network, obtain an IP address, and get updated time from an NTP server. 
The following output should be visible in the serial terminal:

```
Successfully connected to Wi-Fi network '<network name>'.
IPv4 Address Assigned: <IP Address>
Obtaining network time......
Time received from NTP.
```

There will be errors displayed because the device still needs to be created in the IoTConnect platform. Ignore the errors and continue to the next section.

## 10. IoTConnect Device Template Setup

An IoTConnect *Device Template* will need to be created or imported. This defines the data format the platform should expect from the device.

## 12. Verify Connection and Data

* Switch to the Serial Terminal application and Reset the board
* After a few seconds, the device will connect, and begin sending telemetry packets similar to the example below:

```
>: {"d":[{"d":{"version":"03.00.00","random":90,"class":"sitting","confidence":83.1703872680664,"accel":{"x":-0.210693359375,"y":-0.391357421875,"z":0.9013671875}}}]}
```

* Switch back to the IoTConnect GUI in your browser and **Click** "Live Data" on the left Device menu and verify telemetry is being populated

## 13. Visualize Data
The data can be visualized by using the Dynamic Dashboard feature of IoTConnect.  
A preconfigured example dashboard is available here: [psoc6aiimu-example-dashboard.json](files/psoc6aiimu-example-dashboard.json) (Right-click, Save As)

* **Download** the template then select "Create Dashboard" from the top of the IoTConnect portal
* **Select** the "Import Dashboard" option and **Select** the template and device name used previously 

Congratulations, your sample dashboard should look similar to the one below:
